# Personal website for introduce yourself

## Getting Started

I have developed this theme as a personal project. I took inspiration from the wonderful work of Brittany Chiang. You can visit her repository [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)

Since I'm not an expert in ReactJS (the language used in Brittany's project), but I really liked the design, I decided to develop this project using Angular's architecture. The website is not yet connected to any API, and it doesn't have dynamic content. Therefore, all the content is static and stored inside the HTML files in Angular. In the future, I plan to connect it to an API, which will allow me to easily manage the content without having to modify the HTML files in Angular.

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm and Angular CLI installed in your pc. Npm is aviable with NodeJS in [here](https://nodejs.org/es/). After you install npm, install Angular CLI by typping the following command in your terminal

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing

Just clone  the repo and excecute the following command inside the folder proyect

``` bash
npm install
```

### All done!!

Now just run
```
npm start
```
Wait to compile and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) after compile finish
